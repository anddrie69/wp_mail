wp_mail
=======

From this tutorial i will explain about to send email in form with wp_mail and wp_ajax.
How to make this?
The first, we must make form in template. For example this template in file contact.php . And then we must main.js for include Jquery, and then style.css , to make style form or style message information about the sending email. Oke if all file can be created, we must be include script in function.php . This script can be look at file functions.php. In this dunction we include new function, and then wp_ajax to load, and wp_mail to sending mail.

Oke Good Luck
